# Random Password Generator

This is a webpage that randomly generates passwords
Users can set the password length (4~16)

- You can check which characters to include, such as uppercase and lowercase English letters, numbers, and symbols.
- You can exclude characters you don't like by typing them into the exclusion field. For example, I entered 'Rh#97' and the password generated by pressing submit will not contain these characters.
